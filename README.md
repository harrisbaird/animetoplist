# Anime Toplist

This is a CakePHP 1.x project from around 2009.  
At one point, it did get a few million uniques a month.  
This is non-working as parts are missing or have been removed.

* It crawled and categorised pages on streaming anime sites.
* A simple user-editable wiki for each series on the site.
* A site owner section where they can manage and promote their site with Paypal IPN integration.
